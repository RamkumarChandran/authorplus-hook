Authorplus-hook
===============
AuthorPlus plugin will help you to setting up Google Authorship in your 
Liferay Portal and get the rich snippet in the Search Engine Results Page for
Blog entries and Web Contents.

The plugin adds an expando in user profile to set the Google+ profile URL or the
URL of the author BIO page in the portal.

If the expando of the user has the URL:
	> Blogs Portlet will change the entry's author TEXTO to a LINK (href with ?rel=author)
	> Asset Publisher will show author link in Blogs Entries and Web Content if you
	set AUTHOR view in Asset Publisher settings.
	
Enjoy it!
